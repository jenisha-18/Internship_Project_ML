<H1>LOAN PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING </H1>
<p>
  In finance, a loan is lending of the money from an individual or a group to an individual or an organisation etc.
  The borrower requests for the loan and after he/she is approved of the loan, has to repay the sum along with the interest laid on the amount borrowed.
  It is a hercules job to estimate if the borrower will repay the loan.hence it should be automated.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Here, we analyse and predict the loan approval using some machine learning algorithms.
